BDD With Angular
=================

The following is the source that goes along with the video I put together demonstrating angularJS and BDD. All of the development was done in webstorm and the videos cover the BDD workflow I follow.

Karma runner makes testing in angular simple and grunt handles everything else.

You can see the video demo at [http://alan.hietala.ca/2013/09/bdd-with-angularjs-webstorm-and-karma-runner/]


Getting Started
=================

You will need nodeJS, yeoman, and the generator-angular modules installed

* [http://nodejs.org](nodeJS)
* [http://yeoman.io](yeoman)
* [https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular](generator-angular)

Once those are set up you can run

`npm install`

from the project directory to pull in all of the dependencies. Likewise you will need to run

`bower install`

 to pull in the 3rd party javascript dependencies.

Webstorm
===============

For the videos I am using Webstorm 7 with its great integration with karma runner.
